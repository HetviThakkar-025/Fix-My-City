sees 3 options -->
dashboard (main ['/']), all reports, ward/zones
in each:

dashboard page :- shows statistics: (according to 7 zones of ahmedabad)
Pie/bar charts for issue types, statuses, resolution time,
Geo heatmaps by ward/zone 
Weekly/monthly reports export
feedback, ratings, given by user

all reports page: 
all reports given by user (report cards like it was in user)
Filtering options by category, date, severity, status, zone
Assign/route issue to department either manually or by AI (two options: assign manually/ assign automatically with AI) 
Auto-Assignment to zones by AI - Use Case: Automatically route the issue to the right city zone based on zones
- Model: Multi-class text/image classifier - How to Use: Saves admin time by auto-labeling reports.
two very important features of AI: 
1.  Duplicate Report Detection - If many users report the same pothole or broken light, detect similar location + 
text + image + tag - Model: Text similarity model - How to Use: Merge reports and show total votes instead of duplicates.
2.Priority Prediction from Description
- Use Case: Based on the user’s description, automatically assign urgency: High, Medium, 
Low - Model: Text classification - How to Use: Helps admins prioritize which issues to resolve first.

7 ward officers for 7 zones:
same type of page for every logged in ward officer, sees a homepage showing all reports of his/her zone,
Filtering options by category, date, severity,
